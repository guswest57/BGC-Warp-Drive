This repository contains the LaTeX manuscript, Python toy model, and illustrative figures associated with the paper  
**"Field Equations of the WLH Warp Gauge: From a 6D Blueprint to a 4D Effective Theory."**

## Purpose

This project explores how large language models can assist researchers in:
- formulating and documenting high-dimensional theoretical frameworks;
- performing symbolic reductions (6D → 4D) with clear assumptions;
- and generating reproducible synthetic data for conceptual testing.

The **WLH Warp Gauge** is **not** a physical design or working technology.  
It is a *conceptual field-theory model* used to demonstrate:
1. how geometric couplings might appear in a 4D effective action, and  
2. how AI–human co-authoring can produce transparent, reviewable scientific code and manuscripts.

## Ethical and Scientific Scope

- All equations and parameters are *symbolic*.  
- No claim is made of new physical phenomena, experimental verification, or real-world energy manipulation.  
- The project should be cited and interpreted as a **conceptual model of AI-assisted theoretical research**, not as evidence of an operational warp mechanism.
